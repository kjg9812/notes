### All Alleles are mutations, changes in the bases of DNA
* All gene sequences are alleles, so mutations are responsible
mutations affecting pathways
* defective enzyme x
* A to B to Y
* you get an accumulation of A and no effect of B and Y
#### One Gene one enzyme
* mutants defective in metabolism
* study bread mold
* What are the steps in the arginine biosynthesis pathway?
   * complementation test to categorize mutants in particular genes
   * test which mutant/gene corresponds to which step in the pathway
#### Complementation Test: Are mutations a and b different alleles or different loci?
Assume: mutants a and b inactivate the gene’s normal function
Test: cross a with b; test if a “complements” b or not
* wild type is the + (+ is dominant)
cross two mutants -> get a wild type, that means they complement each other
Figure out all the mutant complementation groups
test which step is affected by which mutant group
#### what is the order of genes in a certain enzymatic pathway?
* look at if the chemicals added are required to grow
* if any chemicals, its the first enzyme step
* if it needs a certain one, its the final step
#### revisions to the one gene one enzyme hypothesis
* gene products are not only enzymes
* proteins are not only single peptides
* gene products are not only peptides
* genes include regulatory elements
   * genes are regulated at many levels to ensure precision in the phenotype
#### transcription is regulated
* by transcription factors
   * they bind to cis regulatory elements that are upstream of the gene

#### significance of association
- which snip is closer to the causal gene?
- which snip is more biased in terms of its distribution
- SNP A is more biased, 52.6 % are associated with case, 44.6 are associated with the normal
#### GWAS
- green part is where the SNPs are
### Development
#### Life without conception?
- life without fertilization
    - no conception
    - occurss frequently
    - ex utero, non fertilized mouse embryos
    - some organisms are pathenogenetic
- tetragametic chimeras
    - materials fused from dizygotic twins
    - different genotypes in the same individual
#### Human life cycle
- life is a continuum
    - which part is not "alive"?
    - if we talk about a life cycle, then there is no part that is not alive
#### basic principles of development
- multicellular organisms usually derive from a single cell (zygote)
- cells divide by mitosis
- cells undergo specialization (differentiation), after they are committed (determination) via the expression of particular sets of transcription factors
- each cell only expresses a fraction of the genes encoded in the genome
#### overview of development
- fertilization
- cleavage and cell division (mitosis) result in cell lineage
- morphogenesis (change in cell shape and position) to make gastrula 
- many events occur during these stages:
    - pattern formation (setting up different identities along an axis)
    - cell determination (commitment to a "fate", particular type of cell) -> ex. it will make bone tissue, or muscle tissue etc
    - cell differentiation (including morphogenesis, cell death, and other fates) -> now it adopts this fate and changes the products that it makes
#### stem cells
- stem cell makes more cells that produce more cells
- one daughter continues divisions, the other differentiates
- embryonic stem cells are usually totipotent
    - have potential to make any possible tissue in the body
- adult stem cells are only pluripotent
    - can only make some cells; stem cells lose potency as you make more cells
#### cell lineage
- differentiated cells haev a particular fate
- how do cells become different from a single mitosis? how do they become assymetric in their fates?
#### cues to break symmetry
- daughter cells become different due to:
    - intrinsic cues
        - asymmetric localization of cytoplasmic determinants ex. p granules in germline cells moving to one side
    - extrinsic cues
        - induction (signaling) ex. anchor cell signals the "vulval precursor cells"
#### if you zap the AC and laser it
- neither inner or outer vulva will form
#### steps to acquiring a cell fate/identity
#### pattern formation via a morphogen
- a morphogen determines the fates cell in a concentration dependent manner
- lots of signal around a cell will adopt a certain fate
    - ex. lots does inner, some does outer
##### Hox transcription factors
- misexpression of  HOX gene in wrong segment "transforms" that segment into the identity of another
- loss of expression of appropriate HOX gene also results in transformation into a different segment identity
#### myoD
- myoD is a mster regulatory gene bc it is required and sufficient to determine muscle tissue
how to test this?

experiment 1: knockout of MyoD results in no muscle (required)
    - no muscles will be made

experiment 2: miesexpression of MyoD causes ectopic muscles (sufficient)
    - expect that other cell to make muscles now
    - ectopic: something is produced where it is usually not

#### hierarchical control
- gene makes protein
- protein is a transcription factor that binds to the cis regulatory element
- protein makes proteins which is itself a transcription factor

ex. myoD is a mster regulator
- gene comes on after being produced by gene, then other genes are turned on

#### diversity via differential gene regulation
- most genes are controlled by a combination of different factors
- read out is a result of what factors are produced in a particular cell and what combinatio of control elements there are
- cis regulatory elements are sequences that can be recognized by different transcription factors and be turned on to regulate the expression of that gene

#### without regulation of transcription factor stuff
- if you dont have Pax6 transcription factor, you don't get eyes
- also cancer

#### iPSCs induced pluripotent stem cells
- adding particular transcription factors to cells can cause them to change their "fate

# 11/8/23
### HOX genes
- HOX genes are conserved between different species, but there are many differences that arise
- how does this variation form?
- possible that there are changes in the ways that HOX genes are regulated
- evolutionary changes occur - downstream targets of HOX factors
### evolution can involve changes in developmental timing
- hypothesis of human evolution: there's a delay in the juvenile adult transition
    - chimpanzees mature very quickly, but we don't
### DMRT transcription factors
- coordinate expression of sex identities
- DMRT homologs
- DMRT factors regulate male traits in all eukaryotes

transcription factor: regulating downstream genes

### sex determination: multifactorial
- different levels at which "sex" is "determined" (influenced)
    - pathway to determine chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, phenotypic sex
### chromosomal sex
- human sex is determined by a chromosomal signal
- chromosomal modes of sex determination
    - XY
        - human SRY locus on Y
        - SRY is the gene on Y chromosome that makes transcription factor turning on the male genes
    - XO
        - hermaphrodites
    - ZW
        - females have two different sex chromosomes
- non chromosomal ways of determining sex
    - temperature
        - ex. turtle laying eggs in certain temperature -> determines female or male
    - developmental time
### interpretation of the chromosomal signal determines gonadal sex
- SRY activates expression of other genes involved in testis development; lack of DMRT1 (transcription factor) results in ovary development
- testis produce male hormones (eg. testosterone)
- ovaries produce female hormomnes (eg. estrogen)
### steroid horomones
- eg. testosterone
- steroid because it can penetrate the plasma membrane of the cell
- binds to a hormone receptor protein
- transported into a nucleus where it becomes a transcription factor -> turns on genes
### horomonal control from gonads results in differentiation of duct systems
- duct system -> system that will produce wolffian tubes to deliver sperm or eggs
- start off being able to produce both
- hormones result in male duct system, lack of these hormones results in fallopian tubes
### somatic sex determination
- bi potential structure again
- testosterone converts structure into penis, without it develops female vagina
### secondary sexual phenotypes
- puberty initiates further hormonal changes that affect sexual maturation and somatic sexual traits
    - gonaadal sex identity is still somewhat plastic
- DMRT1 is also required to maintain male fates of testes and for differentiation of male secondary sexual characteristics
### female or male example
- chromosomally woman is male, but phenotypically she is not male
- alternative hypotheses? 
    - the SRY gene on the Y chromosome could not be working
    - another possibility: another gene not on the Y chromosome turned on by the SRY gene
- the answer: lots of testosterone in body, but not receiving it, transcription factors are not turning on
- androgens, male specific hormones
### AIS
- androgen insensitivty syndrome
- functional variability due to different mutations, most affecting hormone reception
### sexual dimorphism
- sexual dimorphism in bodies
    - males trend taller
    - skeletal muscle
    - skeletal anatomy and bone density
    - genes in the liver are sex biased
    - females metabolize drugs faster and store lipids better
- disease probability
    - different propensities to disease states due to sexual dimorphism
    - ex. 80% of autoimmune diseases occur in women
#### environmental effects on sex development
- persistent organic pollutants can act as estrogens
- environmental stress factors act differently on males vs. females
- sexual differences could result from nutritional factors -> nutrition influences epigenetic modifications
#### takeaway
- lots of room for variation in the different steps related to transcription factors and it affects literally everything

# 11/15/23
#### Mosaic Sex
- cis regulatory elements are mossaic
    - different cis elements govern a gene's expression in different tissues
#### sex and policy
- do societal political definitions of biological sex align with biology?
    - biological reality is that there are not two discrete categories

#### idealized model
- a mendelian popuation is an idealized model (null hyp) of a population
- genes behave as mendelian factors
    - alleles segregate independently into gametes
    - alleles at different loci assort independently into zygotes
- mating (fertilization) is random
- population size is vastly large (no genetic drift)
- no mutation
- no gene flow (no migration bteween populations)
- all genotypes have identical fitness (neutral - no selection)

**evolution is a change in allele frequency**

#### test of HWE
1. obtain the observed genotype frequencies in the actual population
2. calculate the observed allele frequencies in the actual population
    - make an expectation of what the distribution would look like if there were random mating
3. use these frequencies to calculate the expected genotype frequencies if the population were in hardy weinberg equilibrium
4. compare the null predictions of genotype frequencies to the observed genotype frequencies

#### observed genotype frequencies
- PCR amplify a segment of the gene surroudnign the area in which a deletion distinguishes the 32 allele from the wild type allele

# 11/29/23
### Selection as a mechanism for evolution
- directional selection will cause anagenesis
    - results from competition between variants
    - results in replacement
- diversifying selection will cause cladogenesis
    - results from lack of competition between variations (specialization)
    - results in co existence
    - splitting of two lineages from common ancestor

### Phylogeny
- history of relationships can be inferred from DNA sequences
- phylogeny is informative about the spread of pathogens and cancer metastasis
- history of human ancestry is revealed in genomic DNA

which trees are the same?
- check which ones merge into the same branch

### inferrring a tree by parsimony
- chracters compared are homologous
- similarities are due more often to shared ancestry than convergence
- each row is a DNA sequence
- each taxa is a species
- DNA sequences are alligned to each other, and there are allignment positions that we think have been inherited

# 12/4/23
Predictions of human ancestry hypotheses
H1: Out of Eden
- the outgroup and earliest branches of the tree would have labels from the middle east

H2: Out of Africa
- same but for african lineages coming out of the bottom of the tree

#### defenses
- t cells need to be trained, cell mediated response
- b cells produce antibodies for the humoral response
    - antibodies immediately recognize and bind to foreign antigens

vaccines hack the system by making antigens
- allow you to make rapid exponse without going through first exposure

# 12/6/23
### Sequencing an unknown piece of DNA
- can take a fragment of the genome and put it into a vector (plasmid) that we know the sequence of
- fragment is in restriction enzyme site called EcoRI site

### sequencing
- will it stop here? maybe
    - small probability that you get a didioxy T and will terminate

# 12/11/23
### Mendelian Population
- how are these assumptions violated and what are the results
1. mating (fertilization) is random 
    - basis for the binomial distribution of genotypes
    - if the population has the binomial distribution it is in the HWE (hardy weinberg)
2. population size is vastly large (no genetic drift)
    - due to chance, small amount of inbreeding
        - allele frequencies change (evolution)
    - evolution means change in allele frequencies
3. no mutation
    - evolution depends on the population size
    - if many individuals, very weak force for evolution
    - if not too many, maybe strong force
    - mutation establishes variation
4. no gene flow (no migration between population)
    - if constant rate of migration, some sort of equilibrium that results
    - allele frequencies are changing and evoluion occurs during migration
5. all genotypes have identical fitness (neutral - no selection)
    - many genotypes do have differences in fitness, selection results from that, and genotype frequencies change
    - you can maintain heterozygosity from some forms of selection -> inverse frequency dependent selection (equalize heterozygosity), heterozygote advantage (in certain conditions heterozygotes are advantageous)

### test if population is in HWE
Using the picture in the slides

**observed frequencies**
frequency of AA is 25/100 = 0.25
frequency of Aa = 0.5
frequency of aa = 0.25
- frequency of A can be calculated using observed genotype frequencies
    - $p = 0.25+ \frac{1}{2}(0.5) = 0.5$
- frequency of a is just 1-p
    - $q = 1-p = 1-0.5 = 0.5$

**expected frequencies**
- p^2, 2pq, q^2
- 0.25, 0.5, 0.25

**how do we test for HWE**
- do the observed values look like the expected values?
    - in this case, yes, this population is in HWE

### population examples
reasons for the population
1. in HWE, if it was just say selection against homozygous recessive
2. selection for heterozygotes
3. diversifying selection, inbreeding
4. in HWE
5. not in HWE, inbreeding because heterozygote frequency is lower than expected

### calculating q given f(aa)
given assumption that population is in HWE
what is q if f(aa) = 1/9

### selection can change allele frequencies
- A is dominant and increasing because of directional selection, A is advantageous
    - but does not become fixed in any of the populations
    - thus the small a allele is in low frequency and hides in heterozygotes
if semidominant
    - fixes fast and increases right away, so big A is recessive

### selection is a result of genetics
results from:
1. variation that affects "fitness"
2. heritabbilty of that variation
3. ability to multiply that variation in a population

why is evoltuion by selection not ranodom?
- because of heritability
- inheritance is not a random process

directional selection will cause anagenesis
    - results from competition between variants
    - results in replacement of the less fit variant by the fitter one
    - there is selection, there is evolution happening within a lineage

diversifying selection will cause cladogenesis
    - lack of competition between variants (specialization)
    - results in co existence of two variants
    - branching in a phylogeny caused by diversifying selection

### human genetic diversity/ancestry
- shown lineages with labels
- human origin is probably africa

### types of taxa
- monophyletic
    - includes all descendants of a common ancestory and that ancestory
    - the only taxon type that reflects phylogeny
- paraphyletic
    - includes some but not all descendants of a common ancestory and that  ancestory
    - sometimes convenient, but completely representative of ancestry
    - ex. apes
- polyphyletic
    - includes unrelated taxa (due to convergent similarity)
    - not reflective of ancestry (not a natural taxon)
    - different groups same label appleies
- race is not a biologically relevant category, none are monophyletic

### cancer is cellular evolution
- where on phylogeny would we look for changes involved in gene metastatis
- look in the two lineages that have metastatic genes

### testing alternative phylogenetic hypoteses
- best score is the lowest sum, requires the lowest amount of changes
