### All Alleles are mutations, changes in the bases of DNA
* All gene sequences are alleles, so mutations are responsible
mutations affecting pathways
* defective enzyme x
* A to B to Y
* you get an accumulation of A and no effect of B and Y
#### One Gene one enzyme
* mutants defective in metabolism
* study bread mold
* What are the steps in the arginine biosynthesis pathway?
   * complementation test to categorize mutants in particular genes
   * test which mutant/gene corresponds to which step in the pathway
#### Complementation Test: Are mutations a and b different alleles or different loci?
Assume: mutants a and b inactivate the gene’s normal function
Test: cross a with b; test if a “complements” b or not
* wild type is the + (+ is dominant)
cross two mutants -> get a wild type, that means they complement each other
Figure out all the mutant complementation groups
test which step is affected by which mutant group
#### what is the order of genes in a certain enzymatic pathway?
* look at if the chemicals added are required to grow
* if any chemicals, its the first enzyme step
* if it needs a certain one, its the final step
#### revisions to the one gene one enzyme hypothesis
* gene products are not only enzymes
* proteins are not only single peptides
* gene products are not only peptides
* genes include regulatory elements
   * genes are regulated at many levels to ensure precision in the phenotype
#### transcription is regulated
* by transcription factors
   * they bind to cis regulatory elements that are upstream of the gene

#### significance of association
- which snip is closer to the causal gene?
- which snip is more biased in terms of its distribution
- SNP A is more biased, 52.6 % are associated with case, 44.6 are associated with the normal
#### GWAS
- green part is where the SNPs are
### Development
#### Life without conception?
- life without fertilization
    - no conception
    - occurss frequently
    - ex utero, non fertilized mouse embryos
    - some organisms are pathenogenetic
- tetragametic chimeras
    - materials fused from dizygotic twins
    - different genotypes in the same individual
#### Human life cycle
- life is a continuum
    - which part is not "alive"?
    - if we talk about a life cycle, then there is no part that is not alive
#### basic principles of development
- multicellular organisms usually derive from a single cell (zygote)
- cells divide by mitosis
- cells undergo specialization (differentiation), after they are committed (determination) via the expression of particular sets of transcription factors
- each cell only expresses a fraction of the genes encoded in the genome
#### overview of development
- fertilization
- cleavage and cell division (mitosis) result in cell lineage
- morphogenesis (change in cell shape and position) to make gastrula 
- many events occur during these stages:
    - pattern formation (setting up different identities along an axis)
    - cell determination (commitment to a "fate", particular type of cell) -> ex. it will make bone tissue, or muscle tissue etc
    - cell differentiation (including morphogenesis, cell death, and other fates) -> now it adopts this fate and changes the products that it makes
#### stem cells
- stem cell makes more cells that produce more cells
- one daughter continues divisions, the other differentiates
- embryonic stem cells are usually totipotent
    - have potential to make any possible tissue in the body
- adult stem cells are only pluripotent
    - can only make some cells; stem cells lose potency as you make more cells
#### cell lineage
- differentiated cells haev a particular fate
- how do cells become different from a single mitosis? how do they become assymetric in their fates?
#### cues to break symmetry
- daughter cells become different due to:
    - intrinsic cues
        - asymmetric localization of cytoplasmic determinants ex. p granules in germline cells moving to one side
    - extrinsic cues
        - induction (signaling) ex. anchor cell signals the "vulval precursor cells"
#### if you zap the AC and laser it
- neither inner or outer vulva will form
#### steps to acquiring a cell fate/identity
#### pattern formation via a morphogen
- a morphogen determines the fates cell in a concentration dependent manner
- lots of signal around a cell will adopt a certain fate
    - ex. lots does inner, some does outer
##### Hox transcription factors
- misexpression of  HOX gene in wrong segment "transforms" that segment into the identity of another
- loss of expression of appropriate HOX gene also results in transformation into a different segment identity
#### myoD
- myoD is a mster regulatory gene bc it is required and sufficient to determine muscle tissue
how to test this?

experiment 1: knockout of MyoD results in no muscle (required)
    - no muscles will be made

experiment 2: miesexpression of MyoD causes ectopic muscles (sufficient)
    - expect that other cell to make muscles now
    - ectopic: something is produced where it is usually not

#### hierarchical control
- gene makes protein
- protein is a transcription factor that binds to the cis regulatory element
- protein makes proteins which is itself a transcription factor

ex. myoD is a mster regulator
- gene comes on after being produced by gene, then other genes are turned on

#### diversity via differential gene regulation
- most genes are controlled by a combination of different factors
- read out is a result of what factors are produced in a particular cell and what combinatio of control elements there are
- cis regulatory elements are sequences that can be recognized by different transcription factors and be turned on to regulate the expression of that gene

#### without regulation of transcription factor stuff
- if you dont have Pax6 transcription factor, you don't get eyes
- also cancer

#### iPSCs induced pluripotent stem cells
- adding particular transcription factors to cells can cause them to change their "fate
