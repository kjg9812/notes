### 3 states
- awake, non rem, and rem
### terms
- sleep latency: how long it takes to fall asleep
    - optimal is 30 mins
- REM latency: amount of time it takes from fall asleep to first REM
- REM density: how much of the time in REM are your eyes moving
- REM rebound: when somebody is underslept, your body will go into REM sooner
- Sleep Onset REM Period (SOREMP)
    - when you go right into REM, narcolepsy
### parts of brain
- frontal lobe
    - thinking part, executive part, who you are
- parietal lobe
    - sensory and spatial orientation
- occiptal lobe
    - visual centers
- temporal lobe
    - hearing, memory consolidation
#### brain in different states
- alpha waves
    - relaxed but awake
- theta waves
    - stage 1, falling asleep

### brain asleep
awake state - beta waves
eyes shut - alpha waves
stage 1 - theta waves
stage 2 - sleep spindles and K-complexes
stage 3 - delta waves, high voltage, slow waves
REM - low voltage, random, fast with sawtooth waves
    - REM looks a lot like awake, brain is really active during REM

### wakefulness
- beta waves predominate
- alpha waves appear most notably when eyes are shut (drowy or not)
- wakefulness accounts for less than 5% of the night in most adults

### when does sleep begin?
- when alpha waves dissapear

### sleep stages - stage 1 (N1)
- Low voltage, mixed frequncy EEG
- defined by exclusion:
    - lack of sleep spindles and k complexes
    - minimal slow save activity
    - no blinking
    - absence of saccadic quick eye movements
    - alpha activity of less than 50% per epoch
### sleep stages - stage 2 (n2)
- defined by the presence of sleep spindles and/or k complexes and the absencee of slow waves (minimal slow wave activity)
- sleep spindles are EEG wave forms in which a sinusoidal rhythm of 12-14 cps waxes and wanes for 1-2 seconds
- k complex is an EEG wave with a well delineated negative sharp wave followed by a slower positive
    - can occur in response to a stimulus (external) but may be spontanenous as well (internal)
- half of our sleep
