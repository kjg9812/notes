### 3 states
- awake, non rem, and rem
### terms
- sleep latency: how long it takes to fall asleep
    - optimal is 30 mins
- REM latency: amount of time it takes from fall asleep to first REM
- REM density: how much of the time in REM are your eyes moving
- REM rebound: when somebody is underslept, your body will go into REM sooner
- Sleep Onset REM Period (SOREMP)
    - when you go right into REM, narcolepsy
### parts of brain
- frontal lobe
    - thinking part, executive part, who you are
- parietal lobe
    - sensory and spatial orientation
- occiptal lobe
    - visual centers
- temporal lobe
    - hearing, memory consolidation
#### brain in different states
- alpha waves
    - relaxed but awake
- theta waves
    - stage 1, falling asleep

### brain asleep
awake state - beta waves
eyes shut - alpha waves
stage 1 - theta waves
stage 2 - sleep spindles and K-complexes
stage 3 - delta waves, high voltage, slow waves
REM - low voltage, random, fast with sawtooth waves
    - REM looks a lot like awake, brain is really active during REM

### wakefulness
- beta waves predominate
- alpha waves appear most notably when eyes are shut (drowy or not)
- wakefulness accounts for less than 5% of the night in most adults

### when does sleep begin?
- when alpha waves dissapear

### sleep stages - stage 1 (N1)
- Low voltage, mixed frequncy EEG
- defined by exclusion:
    - lack of sleep spindles and k complexes
    - minimal slow save activity
    - no blinking
    - absence of saccadic quick eye movements
    - alpha activity of less than 50% per epoch
### sleep stages - stage 2 (n2)
- defined by the presence of sleep spindles and/or k complexes and the absencee of slow waves (minimal slow wave activity)
- sleep spindles are EEG wave forms in which a sinusoidal rhythm of 12-14 cps waxes and wanes for 1-2 seconds
- k complex is an EEG wave with a well delineated negative sharp wave followed by a slower positive
    - can occur in response to a stimulus (external) but may be spontanenous as well (internal)
- half of our sleep

# 2/1/24
### theta waves
- originate in cortex and hippocampus; daydreaming, drowsiness, trance like states
- hypothesized for creativy and achieving "flow"
    - possibly because not thinking about anything else besides the current moment

### whats the point of N2 (sleep spindles and k complexes)
- sleep spindles -> originate in the thalamus
    - thought to represent periods when the brain is inhibiting processing to keep the sleeper tranquil
    - seen in the brain as a burst of activity following a muscle twitch
    - probably important in memory consolidation (clearing out hippocampus to make room for new memories)
    - inhibiting brain processes to keep you asleep
- k complexes -> originate widely in cortex
    - occur naturally (internally) and in response to external stimuli (eg. touch to skin, sounds)
    - thought to suppress cortical arousal and aid in sleep based memory consolidation
    - trying to stop you from waking up if its safe enough

### whats the point of N3 (delta)
- delta waves -> originate in the thalamus or cortex
- stimulate the release of several hormones (growth hormones) and inhib the release of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
- important in declrative memory consolidation
    - two types of memory: declarative (facts, things you can declare, peoples names), performance (how you do things: play guitar, drive a car, ride bike

### memory consolidation
- hippocampal ripples increase during sleep after learning
    - the more increase in ripples, the better the memory consolidation
- disrupting ripples results in disrupted memory and learning

### what could this possibly have to do with REM?
- rem may be important for the developing brain, especially during infancy and childhood
- marijuana decreases REM and deep sleep
- rem may provide a work out or stimulation for the developing brain which leads to more growth than the baby would otherwise obtain
- our muscles are most relaxed during rem, which provides a good opportunity for cell repair and immune system
- rem is good for procedural memory

### memory
- stage 3 -> weeds out unnecessary neural connections
    - occurs earlier in the sleep period
    - moves memory info from short term storage (hippocampus) to long term storage (memory cortex)
- rem -> strengthens those neural connections that matter for our memory
    - occurs later int the sleep period
    - integrates new memories with our backlog of collected memories from the past

### other brain waves
- gamma waves
    - observed by digital EEG
- Mu waves

### the sleep cycle
- cyclic nature of sleep is relaible
- rem periods every 90-120 minutes
- first REM period is shortest

# 2/9/24
### dream def
- a dream is conscious
- a dream is accessible to recal
- a dream occurs during sleep

### who doesnt dream?
- people who never recall dreaming
1. one possibility -> they are terrified of revealing themselves
2. another theory is that these individuals sleep too deeply and are too groggy to focus, recall, and report
3. a third theory suggest sleep depreivation
4. medication or marijuana?

# 2/20/24
- WASO -> wakefulness after sleep onset
    - time person is awake after falling asleep 
    - increases with age

# 2/27/24
### neurochemistry and signal transmission
- stimuli might lead to action potential, change in charge in neurons, release neurotransmitters to post snyaptic neurons, and either keep transmitting or block it

### hormone vs neurotransmitter
- NTs
    - released by neurons
    - act quickly and locally
    - GABA
- hormones
    - released by glgands
    - distributed widely into the bloodstream
    - act slowly and at a distance from their point of release
    - pineal gland releases melatonin

### messengers
- wake promoting
    - acetylcholine, dopamine, histamine, norepinephrine, orexin, sserotonin
- sleep promoting
    - gaba, adenosine, melanin concentrating hormone (but its a neurotransmitter), and melatonin

### acetylcholine
- wake promoting but also REM promoting
- modulator of plasticity, memory, arousal, andd reward
- nuclei in brainstem/ARAS
- alzheimers is the loss of acetylcholine neurons

# 2/29/24
### melanin concentrating hormone
- also REM producing

### melatonin
- hormone modules sleep/wake patterns
- sleep promoting

### sleep debt
- you can't sleep it all back

# 3/5/24
### multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)
- measures sleep latency in two hour intervvals
    - generally at 10 am & 12,2, 4, and 6 pm
    - you try to fall asleep at these times for 20 minutes
- alterness is determined based upon how long it takes you to fall asleep
    - 0-5 minutes is severe
    - 15-20 minutes is excellent
- so basically if you fall asleep easily throughout the day you're underslept

### yawn
- why?
    - herd animals
    - draw in more oxygen
    - brain temperature ccontrol, cool your head
- we start yawning very early, babies in the uterus

### the brain keeps track of sleep debt
- keeps accurate accoutning of how much sleep is owed back
- brain can probably hold sleep debt for 3 weeks
- it is not "normal" to feel drowsy during the daytime
    - so you're probably in sleep debt

### myths
- all food does not make you sleepy
    - except a lot of fat and high carbs
- a boring meeting does not make you sleepy
- a warm room does not make you sleepy

### sleepy food
- high sugar
    - large insulin releases cause more tryptophan to be absorbed by the brain
- high carb
- high fat

### how much sleep do we really need?
- varies across ages
### biphasic sleep
- hypothesized humans had a biphasic sleep pattern
- two 4 hours segments
    - first sleep/deep sleep
    - an hour of gentle activity
    - second sleep/ morning sleep
- electricity probably forced us out of this

### segmented sleep
- common in other cultures
- some people believe forcing sleep into 8 hour night may be the cause of many problems

### what kind of sleep do you need for sleep debt?
- you mostly need deep sleep
- but there's REM rebound, so you go into REM a lot sooner if you're in sleep debt

### we're sleeping less
- than 50 years ago, 1.5-2 hours less

### neurocognitive effects of sleep diruption
- 1 hour less sleep on one night causes changes to EEG responses
- memory performance messed up
- apnea, restless leg syndrome, acaedemic deficits, learning problems, symptoms of ADHD
- computational speed, impair verbal fluency, decrease creativity and abstract problem solving ability

# 3/12/24
### Why are there larks and owls?
- humans evolved to sleep in groups
- some wake up early, some stay up late to guard the clan
